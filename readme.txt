Why we deviated from class applications:

My partner Grace and I decide to deviate from the applications and tool discussed in class for the for a multitude of reasons, all of which will be discussed in this document. 
Grace and I are both pursuing careers in Web-development / design that emphasizes in in JavaScript. We enjoyed learning about python and all its capabilities when it comes to back-end development, but we wanted to tackle a project in a coding language we both pride ourselves in. Especially since we have a professor experienced in this field it would be a privilege to receive feedback on something we are both passionate about. 
Additionally, Grace and I wanted to launch a website that can be used on your portfolios when applying for jobs. Being that this is our last semester we really wanted a diverse application to set ourselves apart from others. It can be argued that we can upload the code to the school server but needs to connect to the school’s database. We wanted to show our capabilities of running and standalone website using MongoDB and Heroku for hosting. 
Grace and I followed the use cases we discussed in the Phase ½ and added some additional features to the website. We are so happy to show-off what we are capable of and cannot wait to see what feedback you have for us. However, we are deeply sorry for any inconvenience this may cause you when it comes to grading our project. Please don’t hesitate to email us any questions or concerns.

Thank you,

Foundation of the website was built on React. Majority of the website is developed in JavaScript.
We used "The Movie Database API" for retrieving movie information.
MongoDB host our entire database collection;
	Comments
	User Accounts
	Favorites
Heroku was used as a hosting service so we could deploy the website live to the world.
The code located on the ~/projects folder contains the websites code WITHOUT the node modules.
For a better understanding of who did what:
	All of Grace's code ~/projcet/server/
	All of Anthony's Code ~/project/client/
